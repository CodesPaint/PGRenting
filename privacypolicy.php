AmayaRooms Privacy Notice
Last updated: 11/01/2018
AmayaRooms is committed to protecting your information. This privacy notice provides details about the information we collect about you, how we use it and how we protect it. It also explains your rights and how to contact us if you have questions about how we use your information.

Information about Amaya
In this privacy notice, references to “Amaya”, “AmayaRooms”, "we" or "us" or “our” are to Oravel Stays Singapore Pte. Limited (a company incorporated under the laws of Singapore) and its parent company and its subsidiaries (the “Amaya Group”).

Scope of our privacy notice
This notice applies to anyone who interacts with us in relation to our products and services (“you”, “your”), via any channel (e.g. app, website, email, phone, walk-ins to Amaya-branded accommodations, booking an Amaya-branded accommodation via a third party travel agency, etc.). We may give you additional privacy notices if required for specific interactions.

If you book a stay through us at one of our partners’ guest houses, hotels and other lodgings (i.e. you stay at a property that is not Amaya-branded), that partner will use your personal data as shown in their privacy notice.

Ways in which we obtain personal information
We obtain personal information from you and from travel agents and others who book accommodation for you.

Where you provide us with information about other individuals (e.g. the names of others who you will stay at the accommodation you book), you must ensure that they have seen a copy of this privacy policy and are comfortable with you doing this.

Categories of personal information
We process two categories of personal information about you and/or, where applicable, others whom you have booked accommodation for, namely:

    • Standard personal information (e.g. information we use to contact you, identify you or manage our relationship with you); and

    • Special categories of information (e.g. if you have indicated a halal or kosher food preference or have chosen to let us know that you have a medical condition requiring special accommodations).

For further information on these categories of information, please expand this section

Purposes and lawful grounds of our processing personal information
We process your personal information for the purposes set out in this notice, based on the legal grounds set out under the Read More text. Different legal grounds apply depending on what category of personal information we process. Standard personal information is normally processed by us on the basis that it is necessary for the performance of a contract, our or a third parties’ legitimate interests or law. Further information about this and special category processing grounds is set out below.

Legitimate interests
We process your personal information for a number of legitimate interests, including providing you with services, administering our relationship with you, for marketing and service/product improvement purposes and in order to exercise our rights or handle claims. More detailed information about our legitimate interests is set out below.

Marketing and Preferences
We use your personal information to send you marketing by post, telephone, social media platforms, email, SMS, application notifications and silent notifications to track installation status of the application. We may also use your personal information to carry out online paid marketing activities in the nature of retargeting.

We also use technology to help us understand your personal preferences and interests so that we can send recommendations and marketing communications that are likely to be of more interest to you. Using technology in this way is sometimes known as profiling.

If you wish to unsubscribe from emails sent by us, you can do so at any time by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link that appears in all emails and by adjusting the settings on your device to turn off notifications from our app. Otherwise, you can always contact us at dataprotection@Amayarooms.com to update your contact preferences. You may also object to profiling relating to direct marketing by contacting us at dataprotection@Amayarooms.com.

Analytics and Advertising Services Provided by Others
Third parties provide us with audience measurement and analytics services that analyse your online interactions (both with the Amaya and other websites), serve you with tailored marketing and report on the performance of that marketing. We also use Google Place API to make suggestions based on your location or search strings.


Amaya Rooms is using Google Place API for place prediction. Please refer to their privacy policy. http://www.google.com/privacy.html

Sharing your information
We share your information within the Amaya Group and with others who help us provide services to you (e.g. your accommodation provider). We also share your information in accordance with the law. For more information on who we share your information with, please expand this section.

We share your information for the purposes set out in this privacy policy, with the following categories of recipients:

    • Other members of the Amaya Group;

    • With accommodation managers to enable them to provide the services you request, e.g. we share your name and expected check-in time;

    • Third party suppliers who help deliver products or services on our behalf, or who have partnered with Amaya in connection with services or a relevant promotional offering, as well as other apps or websites that integrate with our API or Services, or those with an API or Service with which we integrate;

    • Your contact if you use a referral feature;

    • The general public, if you submit content in a public forum, such as blog comments, social media posts, or other features of our services that are obviously viewable by the general public. For example, you may choose to use social sharing features and related tools which let you share your Amaya experience with other apps, sites, or media, and vice versa. Your use of these features enables the sharing of information with your friends or the public, depending on your social sharing service settings. Please refer to the privacy policies of those social sharing services for more information about how they handle the data you provide to or share through them;

    • Third parties where we have a duty to or are permitted to disclose your personal information by law (e.g. law enforcement officials, government authorities);

    • With the police in the exercise of their functions or with others as required by a court order;

    • Third parties in connection with any merger, sale of company assets, consolidation or restructuring, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of the Amaya Group’s business, in which case personal data held by it about its customers or visitors to the website may be one of the transferred assets.

Where we share your personal information, appropriate protections will be in place to protect your personal information as required by data protection laws. Sometimes, we may share information in an aggregated, pseudonymised and/or anonymised form which cannot reasonably be used to identify an individual.

Transfers outside of your country
Amaya uses global information systems. As a result, Amaya transfers your personal information to a country outside of your country, including to India and Singapore, for the purposes set out in this policy. Not all countries outside of EEA have data protection laws that are similar to those in the EEA and they may not be regarded by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of data protection.

Amaya takes steps to ensure that when your personal information is transferred internationally, it is subject to appropriate safeguards in accordance with data protection laws. Often, these safeguards include contractual safeguards. More information about these safeguards (including copies, where relevant) can be obtained by contacting [dataprotection@Amayarooms.com].

Retention period
We retain your personal information in accordance with Amaya’s records retention policies. However, there may be circumstances that mean we must retain your personal information for longer (e.g. if you make a claim in relation to a booking).

Your rights
Data protection laws in the EEA and some other countries provide individuals with rights in relation to the information that Amaya holds about them on some computer and paper records. These include rights to access, correct, delete, restrict the use of, object to the use of, port to another person, and withdraw consent to the use of, your information. Exceptions may apply to these rights.

Data protection contacts
If you have any questions, comments, complaints or suggestions in relation to this notice, or any other concerns about the way in which we process information about you, please contact our Privacy Team at dataprotection@Amayarooms.com.

If you are not satisfied with the response from our Privacy Team, you can contact our Data Protection Officer at [dataprotection@Amayarooms.com].

You also have a right to make a complaint to your local privacy supervisory authority. If you are in the EU, you can lodge a complaint with another supervisory authority which is based in the country or territory where:

    • You are living

    • You work, or

    • The alleged infringement took place.

A list of the EU data protection supervisory authorities is here.
